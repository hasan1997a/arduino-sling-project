# Arduino Sling Project

A digital manufacturing project using Arduino and servo motors.  
Implementation of a mechanical launching system (rogatka) with dual-axis control (X and Z) and a programmable triggering mechanism.

## Project Description

This project was developed as part of a laboratory assignment in the field of digital manufacturing.  
It demonstrates the integration of mechanical design, electronics, and embedded programming to create a controllable slingshot mechanism.
